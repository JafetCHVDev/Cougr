//! Tap Battle — On-Chain Mobile-First Competitive Tapping Game
//!
//! This smart contract implements a competitive tapping game on the Stellar
//! blockchain using cougr-core's ECS framework and passkey authentication.
//!
//! # Mobile-First Authentication Flow
//! This example demonstrates the complete passkey → session → gameplay flow:
//! 1. **Registration**: Player registers a passkey (secp256r1 public key)
//!    → No seed phrases, no mnemonics — just Face ID / Touch ID
//! 2. **Authentication + Session**: Player authenticates via passkey
//!    → `verify_secp256r1()` validates the biometric signature
//!    → `SessionBuilder` creates a gameplay session scoped to `tap` + `use_power`
//! 3. **Gameplay (gasless via session key)**: Rapid tapping is processed
//!    through the session key with no per-transaction wallet prompts
//! 4. **Result**: Scores compared, winner declared, stats recorded on-chain
//!
//! # Cougr-Core Integration
//! - `secp256r1_auth`: Passkey registration and signature verification
//! - `SessionBuilder`: Scoped session creation for gasless gameplay
//! - ECS Components: `PasskeyIdentity`, `TapCounter`, `PowerUp`, `RoundState`
//! - ECS World: Entity management for game objects
